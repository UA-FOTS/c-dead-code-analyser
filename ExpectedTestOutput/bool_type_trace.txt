Counter validation loop started.
Counter Validation loop finished.
The following functions where found:

Function main with return type int and no parameters is NOT OK.
The function has the following issues: 
	Incorrect return type, return type must be boolean.
Since at least one of the functions was found to be invalid, no counter automaton will be generated.
