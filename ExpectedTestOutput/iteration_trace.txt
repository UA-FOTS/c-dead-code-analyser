Counter validation loop started.
Counter Validation loop finished.
The following functions where found:

Function main with return type int and no parameters is NOT OK.
The function has the following issues: 
	Incorrect return type, return type must be boolean.
The function has the following counter variable(s):
	Counter with name i is first used at line 7 and last used at line 9
	Counter with name j is first used at line 13 and last used at line 16
	Counter with name k is first used at line 20 and last used at line 20

Function t with return type bool and no parameters is OK for one counter automaton generation.
The function has the following counter variable(s):
	Counter with name i is first used at line 26 and last used at line 28
	Counter with name j is first used at line 32 and last used at line 35
	Counter with name k is first used at line 39 and last used at line 39

Function f with return type bool and no parameters is NOT OK.
The function has the following issues: 
	Incorrect number of counters, this tool can only handle a maximal number of counters equal to 1.
The function has the following counter variable(s):
	Counter with name j is first used at line 45 and last used at line 58
	Counter with name i is first used at line 51 and last used at line 53
Since at least one of the functions was found to be invalid, no counter automaton will be generated.
