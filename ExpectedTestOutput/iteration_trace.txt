The following symbol table was derived from the code:
================= main =================
symbol j with type int has value 0, this value is used: False, this variable is a counter.
symbol k with type int has value 0, this value is used: False, this variable is a counter.
================= for_scope_0 =================
symbol i with type int has value 5, this value is used: False, this variable is a counter.
================= t =================
symbol j with type int has value 0, this value is used: False, this variable is a counter.
symbol k with type int has value 0, this value is used: False, this variable is a counter.
================= for_scope_3 =================
symbol i with type int has value 5, this value is used: False, this variable is a counter.
================= f =================
symbol j with type int has value 0, this value is used: False, this variable is a counter.
================= for_scope_7 =================
