symbol a with type int has initial value a and final value 0, this value is used: True, this variable is a counter and is a parameter.
symbol b with type int has initial value b and final value 0, this value is used: True, this variable is not a counter and is a parameter.
symbol counter1 with type int has initial value 0 and final value 0, this value is used: True, this variable is a counter and is not a parameter.
symbol counter2 with type int has initial value 0 and final value 0, this value is used: True, this variable is a counter and is not a parameter.

Counter Validation loop finished.
The following functions where found:

Function test_too_many_counters with return type int and parameter types ['int', 'int'] is NOT OK.
The function has the following issues: 
	Error found on line 5, relational expressions must be evaluations of a counter with a parameter or constant, these expressions can not be between counters.
	Incorrect return type, return type must be boolean.
	Incorrect number of counters, this tool can only handle a maximal number of counters equal to 1.
The function has the following counter variable(s):
	Counter with name a is first used at line 2 and last used at line 9
	Counter with name counter1 is first used at line 5 and last used at line 6
	Counter with name counter2 is first used at line 5 and last used at line 6
